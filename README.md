# Fortify
A base defense game made for my grade 12 computer science final.

# How to get the game
Getting this game is pretty easy. If you are on macOS or Windows, there are prebuild binaries available for you in the releases page. If you are on linux, you should be able to run the source code using <a href="https://processing.org/">processing-java</a>. Make sure to install the Sound library.
